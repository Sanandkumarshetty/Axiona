# Database Entities Overview

This document summarizes the database entity files found in the project under `server/src/models/`. As of this analysis, the files are present but do not contain any schema definitions, fields, or relationships. They are currently placeholders.

## Entity Files

- `User.ts`
- `Quiz.ts`
- `Note.ts`
- `Document.ts`
- `Conference.ts`
- `Attempt.ts`

## Status

All files above only contain comments (e.g., `// User model`) and do not define any database schema, fields, or relationships. There is no information about tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, or entity relationships in the codebase.

## Next Steps

To enable database integration, you should:

- Define the schema for each entity (fields, types, constraints)
- Specify relationships (e.g., foreign keys, references)
- Implement the models using an ORM (e.g., Mongoose for MongoDB, Sequelize for SQL)
